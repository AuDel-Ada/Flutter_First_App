# flutter_first_app

First time on Flutter, so time to play !!

I am referring to this project:
https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-codelab-first?hl=fr#2

You will find a looot of comments in main.dart, as I use this project
to understand the Dart syntax and the Flutter running.

## Getting Started

CLI: Flutter run and r for hot reload
(the application state is not lost during the reload. To reset the state, use hot restart instead)
You can use F5 or run & debug icon, as well.

Target device can be changed first at the screen bottom.
This project is checked on Chrome for desktop & Galaxy S9 for mobile.
